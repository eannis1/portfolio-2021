            <h2>History of the Cocktail</h2>
            <p>Where did the cocktail come from? David Wondrich, spirits historian and author of <i>Imbibe</i>,
            relates that the first mention of such a drink was in an 1803 newspaper from New Hampshire. The article
            satirized "the fast young men of its day by printing what was purportedly an extract from one of 
            their diaries." In this imaginary diary entry, a hungover young man admits to feeling "rather squally.”
            The cure? A "glass of cocktail" which, he confides to his diary, is "excellent for the head."</p>
            <p>Where did the term "cocktail" originate, however? Wondrich believes that it has rather unsavory
                origins: "Among the many curious definitions found in Francis Grose's 1785 
                <i>A Classical Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue</i>, a work with which I have been obsessed for 
                nigh on 30 years, is the one for the verb 'to feague' . . . which Grose defines as to 
                put 'ginger up a horse's fundament, to make him lively and carry his tail well.' A horse dealer 
                would do this before exhibiting the poor ginger-suppositoried beast for sale, a raised or 
                cocked-up tail being a sign of a spirited horse. Grose goes on to add that the term is 
                'used figuratively for encouraging or spiriting one up.' Yes, well."</p>
            <p>Though by the middle of the eighteenth century the use of bitters in spirits such as gin, brandy,
                and wine was common in both Britain and the American colonies, the terms used to describe these
                drinks diverged by the early nineteenth century. Wondrich's research indicates that while in 
                England "cocktail remained the stimulant—ginger or sometimes hot pepper—that you added to a drink
                . . . [In America] we extended the name of the spicy element to cover the whole shebang."
            <p>As a proud resident of New York state, Wondrich gleefully concludes that Americans likely began to use 
                the term "cocktail" with this new meaning in the Hudson Valley area of New York in the early 1800s.
                From there, it spread to the rest of the United States and around the world.</p>
